Cairn is a general-purpose problem-solving engine. <br/>It defines no roles, no workflows. Given an origin and a goal, it searches for a path through an unknown state space. <br/>AI Penetration Testing is one such problem — and a proven one.

## What is Cairn?

Penetration testing is fundamentally a **directed search through a near-infinite state space**:

- **Origin**: known (target IP, target system)
- **Goal**: defined (get a shell, capture the flag)
- **Path**: unknown

This structure is not unique to penetration testing. Vulnerability research, mathematical proof, CTF challenges — any problem with a clear starting point, a clear success condition, and an unknown path in between shares the same shape.

Cairn is built for this class of problems. Penetration testing is the first domain it has been validated on.

The engine is built on a **Blackboard Architecture** with an explicit fact-intent graph. Three primitives are all it needs:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Fact** | A confirmed, objective finding written to the board |
| **Intent** | A declared direction of exploration, not yet executed |
| **Hint** | Human judgment injected at any time; absorbed by agents on the next read |

The graph grows from `origin` toward `goal`. Every new Fact is a stepping stone; every Intent is a step into the unknown.

Agent Workers run an OODA loop — Observe the full graph, Orient to the current state, Decide on next intents, Act to explore — and write their findings back as new Facts. Workers have no fixed roles. Tasks are generated at runtime from the graph's current state, not from predefined job descriptions.

Agents coordinate exclusively through the shared board (Stigmergy). No direct communication. No information silos.

## How It Works

Three task types, all executed by the same Worker:

| Task | What it does | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Bootstrap** | At project start, attempts to solve the problem directly | Fact + possible Complete |
| **Reason** | Reads the full graph: is the goal met? What should be explored next? | Complete / new Intents / no-op |
| **Explore** | Claims one Intent, executes the exploration, reports findings | One Fact |

System architecture:

```

**Cairn Server** maintains graph consistency only.

**Cairn Dispatcher** reads the graph, schedules tasks, launches local agent commands, and is the sole writer to the protocol. Multiple Agent Workers can run concurrently on the host. Agent Workers only receive a prompt and return structured output.

Supported worker backends: **Codex** and **Pi**. The dispatcher still has a Claude Code driver for compatibility, but the default configuration is Codex-first.

## Results

**Tencent Cloud Hackathon · AI Penetration Testing Challenge · 2nd Edition**

610 teams · 1,345 participants · top universities and security firms across China

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Problems solved | **54 / 54 — only team to AK** |
| Final ranking | 3rd |

> The system had never been tested before the competition. The full pipeline came online for the first time at 4 AM on race day. No training, no tuning, no domain-specific tooling. Zero MCP tools, zero RAG, zero predefined agent roles.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
 
- macOS or Linux
- Python ≥ 3.12
- `uv`
- At least one local worker CLI on `PATH`: `claude` for Claude Code or `codex` for Codex


Create your local dispatcher configuration:

```bash
cp dispatch.example.yaml dispatch.yaml
```

Worker commands run directly on this machine. There is no Docker daemon, Docker socket, or worker image in the local runtime.
For Codex, the default worker mode uses the already authenticated local `codex` CLI, so no API key is required after `codex login`. API-key mode remains available from the Web UI if you want to point Codex at a custom endpoint.
 
### Local launcher (recommended)
 
```bash
uv run --project cairn cairn launch --config dispatch.yaml
```
 
This starts the Web/API server on `0.0.0.0:8000`, waits for it to become healthy, then starts the dispatcher in the same process. Open it from this machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or from another device using this machine's LAN/Tailscale IP, for example `http://100.103.239.9:8000/`. The dispatcher invokes your local `claude` or `codex` CLI according to `dispatch.yaml`.

Storage locations used at runtime:
- Worker config: `dispatch.yaml` (and model catalog: `dispatch.models.yaml` next to it).
- Runtime artifacts are consolidated under `./workspace/` (git-ignored). Override the location with the `CAIRN_WORKSPACE` env var.
  - SQLite DB: `workspace/cairn.db`.
  - Prompt snapshots referenced by workers: `workspace/prompts/<phase>-<random>/graph.yaml` (override with `CAIRN_GRAPH_SNAPSHOT_ROOT` env var).

The Web UI can edit worker API settings, and runtime config changes are hot-reloaded: the dispatcher reloads after current tasks finish when config is updated.
Model names are now managed from the same UI (save/delete/set default), persisted in `dispatch.models.yaml` next to `dispatch.yaml` by default.
 
### Manual split-process mode
 
```bash
# Start the server
uv run --project cairn cairn serve
 
# Run the dispatcher
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml
 
# Run startup health checks only
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml --startup-healthcheck-only
```

### Tests

Run the fast regression suite without live model endpoints:

```bash
uv run --project cairn --group dev pytest
```
